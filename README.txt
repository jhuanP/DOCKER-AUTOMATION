This docker shell is fully funtional, I have tested each element.
if you have more to add be my guest, just share it back with me so I can keep 
this updated.

To use this you must place it in the directory that your dockerfile is in, or
edit the shell to have docker build command target the location of your 
dockerfile, and give the file execution permissions e.g. chmod u+x docker.sh

hope you enjoy, thanks for reading.
